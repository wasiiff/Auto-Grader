Laiba,98,95,"Excellent article that thoughtfully explores the evolution and nuances of feminish language, exceeding the word count requirement and demonstrating strong understanding and structure."
Faiq,69,85,"Well-written and on-topic, though it could benefit from exploring the nuances of the debate more deeply and providing more concrete examples."
Ali Iftikhar,50,70,The article is on-topic and well-written but significantly short and lacks depth in exploring the complexities of feminism beyond the specific linguistic phenomenon.
Wasif,078,2,The submission is completely off-topic; it discusses climate change instead of feminism and fails to meet the assignment requirements.
