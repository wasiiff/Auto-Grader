Student Name,Roll Number,Score,Remarks
Laiba,98,70,"The essay is well-written and insightful, but it narrowly focuses on the evolution of feminized suffixes rather than providing a broader discussion of feminism as a whole. It also falls significantly short of the required word count."
Faiq,69,40,"The submission is far too short and lacks depth, reads more like a dictionary entry than an essay on feminism, and is missing key components of a comprehensive exploration of the topic."
Ali Iftikhar,50,20,"The submission is severely lacking in length and scope, presenting a very narrow and superficial view of feminism rather than a comprehensive essay as instructed."
Wasif,078,10,"The submission is completely off-topic and fails to address the prompt on Feminism, therefore receives a failing grade."
